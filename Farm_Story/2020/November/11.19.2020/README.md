# Advancements today - November 19th 2020

I made some progress in Farm Story today:

1. I got really close to leveling up

2. I was able to do my first full collection since I switched to weekly gameplay. I found a crop that takes 8 days to expire (since I will collect it in 7 days, I am able to collect it on time) I am hoping there is no issue when I go to collect next week on November 19th 2020

3. No other progress today
